- It will make the text bolder if the default text is already bold

\<b> vs \<strong> <br>

- ins is used with del


### Block vs Inline
- A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

- A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
