# JavaScript Code Execution


-> Call Stack
line by line execution,
first item: Global Execution Context
all functions are pushed in the stack and executed in order

-> Javascript waits for none.


### setTimeout(callbackfn, time);

-> setTimeout will send the callback function to stack after the given time, till then it's kept aside and normal execution continues.
