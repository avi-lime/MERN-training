--- Day 4 | JS ---

## Objects:

-> Cannot reassign const Objects
-> But can change object members

eg.
const obj = {
    "name": "Avi",
    "age": 21
}

obj.lastName = "Singh" // [O]
obj.age = 20 // [O]

obj = {
    "name": "Avinash"
}   //  [X]


Arrays:

-> Arrays are Objects
eg. const arr = [1, 2, 3]

arr[10] = 20;
// [1, 2, 3, empty x 7, 20]

-> Push an element in the array
arr.push(10);
-> Pushes an element at the end of the array.


## Array Methods

Array.isArray(arr)

// checks if `arr` is an Array or not, can be used to differ between Objects and Arrays



-> map, array, reduce, filter, sort, forEach

## For loops in JS

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++)

-> for of loop
- Used for arrays
for (let i of arr)

-> for in loop
- Used for Objects
for (let key of obj)


# Document Object Model (DOM)

-> It's an API (Application Program Interface) that can be used in JavaScript
-> It's not a part of JavaScript
-> It's a Tree Model of all the elements (as Objects) in the HTML Document

=> Window Object

-> Represents an open window in a browser
-> It is a Global object

console.log() is a Window method
- window.console.log()
- console.log(console)

height, width, innerHeight, innerWidth etc are properties
- window.height, window.width

### Class

properties -> variables
methods -> function



## document functions
-> getElementById()
-> getElementsByTagname()


## element 

-> cloneNode() [ Copies everything, inlcuding Element ID as well ]

### deep copy vs shallow copy

## Events in JavaScript

-> Events are things that happen in the system
-> It can be something done by the browser or the user.
eg. button click, page load etc.




### Event Delegation

-> Instead of attaching an Event Listener to all the buttons/child nodes, assign a single Event listener to the parent element
