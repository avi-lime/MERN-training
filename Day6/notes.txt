--- Day 6 | And More JS! ---

cl("start")
setTimeout(fn, 0)
cl("end")

## Event Loop

High Priority -> Microtask Queue

Low Priority -> Callback Queue


<--- Code Execution --->

line-by-line
1st console log

setTimeout is sent to call back queue till the main execution is over.
As soon as the call stack is empty, the pending tasks are sent to the call stack

--> Inversion of Control
- Giving control to some other function


=> Why Promises?

<--- BACKEND!! --->


Client - Server Architecture

Client requests data from Server and the Server responds with the data/page which is then rendered by the browser

Latency -> Time taken for the client request to reach the server and vice versa
- Round Trip Latency = total time from client request to server response

Processing Time -> Time taken by the server to process the request

Response Time -> Round Trip Latency + Processing Time 

Bandwidth -> Maximum Data that can be transferred through a channel

Throughput -> The actual capacity of the data that can be transferred 


http vs https:

https encrypts the data packets
https has SSL certificate

http packets can be read by interceptors

IP Address, MAC Address
Router, ISP, Internet
DNS
